# Numerical-Methods
This repository serves as a personal portfolio for learning software development and numerical methods for engineering applications.The goal is to accompany numerical methods and analysis with programming and software development. Topics of Roots of Equations, Systems of Linear Algebraic Equations, Curve Fitting, Integration, and Ordinary Differential Equations. The particular interest on Electrical Engineering application will be dealt such as Design of an Electrical Circuit, Currents and Voltages in Resistor Circuits, Curve Fitting to Estimate the RMS Current, Determination of the Root-Mean-Square Current by Integration, and Simulating Transient Current for an Electric Circuit.

The booked used for this purpose is "Numerical Methods for Engineers with Personal Computer Applications" by Steven A Chapra and Raymond P. Canale. The text may be outdated and uses Fortran and BASIC as the programming language, but the concept of numerical methods will be the main takeaway.

The author of this repository believes that a complement of Electrical Engineering and Software Development will be beneficial to the growth of skills and knowledge and expand opportunities for a career in engineering. Currently taking the challenge of learning programming starting at a novice level.
